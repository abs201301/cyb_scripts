#    Get-SAML_MFAKey

##    Overview
The scripts written in Python and Powershell serve the same purpose, i.e. generating the MFA caching SSH key over REST API and saving it to the location of choice.

##    File Names and their description

**GetMFAKey.ps1** - This is the powershell script that uses Powershell's windows forms in combination with Edge WebView to simulate the browser session to IDP (Microsoft Online). 
As soon as number matching (MFA) is confirmed, the script using "Navigating" handler retrieves the SAMLResponse from DOC HTML parser and closes the browser window. Then REST API call to CyberArk is invoked to download the SSH key. The script also, generates secure passphrase at runtime.

**GetMFAKey.py** - This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of logging into an Identity Provider (IDP) using Selenium, capturing the SAMLResponse from network requests, and utilizing it for subsequent API calls. Itâ€™s designed to handle MFA scenarios (including number matching) and includes error handling to ensure reliability.

**Language** - Powershell, Python
