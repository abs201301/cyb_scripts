# Sync-ADPPA
PowerShell automation to synchronize Active Directory (AD) Privileged Access (PPA) accounts with CyberArk, backed by an SQL database and ServiceNow integration for incident tracking.
This script is designed to keep CyberArk safes and accounts aligned with AD and organizational policies while ensuring failures are logged, emailed, and tracked in ServiceNow
